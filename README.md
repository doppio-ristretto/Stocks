# Stocks
This repository is a machine learning project focused on predicting adj. closing prices of stocks.  We used finnhub and yahoo finance to obtain our data.  The data ranges from 1990 to 2020 and is broken down by quarterly periods. We have a live website to view our finding and data in a more digestible fashion than reading raw code.  The link is provided below.
